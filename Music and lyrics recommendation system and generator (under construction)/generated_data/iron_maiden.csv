  ""There,"" calls the Mariner, ""There comes a ship o’er the line But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?"" See, onward she comes Onward she nears, out of the sun See, she has no crew She has no life, wait but there's two  Death and she Life-in-Death They throw their dice for the crew She wins the Mariner and he belongs to her now Then, crew one by one They drop down dead, two hundred men She, she, Life-in-Death She lets him live, her chosen one    ""One after one by the star-dogged Moon Too quick for groan or sigh Each turned his face with a ghastly pang And cursed me with his eye Four times fifty living men And I heard nor sigh nor groan With heavy thump, a lifeless lump They dropped down one by one.""

Hear the groans of the long-dead seamen See them stir and they start to rise Bodies lifted by good spirits None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes And revenge still is sought, penance starts again Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on  Now the curse is finally lifted And the Mariner sights his home Spirits go from the long-dead bodies Form their own light and the Mariner's left alone  And then a boat came sailing towards him It was a joy he could not believe The Pilot's boat, his son, and the Hermit Penance of life will fall onto him  And the ship, it sinks like lead into the sea And the Hermit shrieves the Mariner of his sins  The Mariner's bound to tell of his story To tell this tale wherever he goes To teach God's word by his own example That we must love all things that God made  And the Wedding guest's a sad and wiser man And the tale goes on and on and on and on"

 I am not a preacher, I am but a man You cannot imagine what I've seen and done  Sleep with a light that is dark to my eyes Father and sons give me all of your lies The brutal truth, that is never a lie Full moon is out, as you look to the sky   I am not a preacher, I am but a man You cannot imagine what I've seen and done   Open your heart and I'll open your soul Even in quieter moments, I know  I am not a preacher, I am but a man You cannot imagine what I've seen and done
 Eerie collection, darkness is there Wedded to danger, betrothed to despair"
