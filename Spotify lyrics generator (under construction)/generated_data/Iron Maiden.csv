 Youll take my life but Ill take yours too 
 Youll fire your musket but Ill run you through 
 So when youre waiting for the next attack 
 Youd better stand theres no turning back 
 The bugle sounds the charge begins 
 But on this battlefield no one wins 
 The smell of acrid smoke   and horses breath 
 As I plunge on into certain death 
 
  
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
  
 The horse he sweats with fear we break to run 
 The mighty roar of the Russian guns 
 And as we race towards the human wall 
 The screams of pain as my comrades fall 
 We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground 
 And the Russians fire another round 
 We get so near yet so far away 
 We wont live to fight another day 
 
  
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 
  
  
  
 
  
 We get so close near enough to fight 
 When a Russian gets me in his sights 
 He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow 
 A burst of rounds takes my horse below 
 And as I lay there gazing at the sky 
 My bodys numb and my throat is dry 
 And as I lay forgotten and alone 
 Without a tear I draw my parting groan  
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh"

 White man came across the sea 
 He brought us pain and misery 
 He killed our tribes he killed our creed 
 He took our game for his own need 
 We fought him hard we fought him well 
 Out on the plains we gave him hell 
 But many came too much for Cree 
 Oh will we ever be set free? 
 
  
 Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes 
 Galloping hard on the plains 
 Chasing the redskins back to their holes 
 Fighting them at their own game 
 Murder for freedom the stab in the back 
 Women and children are cowards attack 
 
  
 Run to the hills run for your lives 
 Run to the hills run for your lives 
 
  
 Soldier blue in the barren wastes 
 Hunting and killings their game 
 Raping the women and wasting the men 
 The only good Indians are tame 
 Selling them whiskey and taking their gold 
 Enslaving the young and destroying the old  
 Run to the hills run for your lives 
 Run to the hills run for your lives 
 
  
 
  
 Run to the hills run for your lives 
 Run to the hills run for your lives 
 Run to the hills run for your lives 
 Run to the hills run for your lives"

 I am a man who walks alone 
 And when Im walking a dark road 
 At night or strolling through the park 
 When the light begins to change 
 I sometimes feel a little strange 
 A little anxious when its dark 
 
  
 Fear of the dark fear of the dark 
 I have a constant fear 
 That somethings always near 
 Fear of the dark fear of the dark 
 I have a phobia that someones always there 
  
 Have you run your fingers down the wall 
 And have you felt your neck skin crawl 
 When youre searching for the light? 
 Sometimes when youre scared 
 To take a look at the corner of the room 
 Youve sensed that somethings watching you 
 
  
 Fear of the dark fear of the dark 
 I have constant fear 
 That somethings always near 
 Fear of the dark fear of the dark 
 I have a phobia that someones always there 
 
  
 Have you ever been alone at night 
 Thought you heard footsteps behind 
 And turned around and no-ones there? 
 And as you quicken up your pace 
 You find it hard to look again 
 Because youre sure theres someone there 
 
  
 Fear of the dark fear of the dark 
 I have constant fear 
 That somethings always near 
 Fear of the dark fear of the dark 
 I have a phobia that someones always there  
 
  
 Fear of the dark fear of the dark 
 Fear of the dark fear of the dark 
 Fear of the dark fear of the dark 
 Fear of the dark fear of the dark 
 Fear of the dark fear of the dark 
 Fear of the dark fear of the dark 
 Fear of the dark fear of the dark 
 Fear of the dark fear of the dark 
 
  
 Watching horror films the night before 
 Debating witches and folklore 
 The unknown troubles on your mind 
 Maybe your mind is playing tricks 
 You sense and suddenly eyes fix 
 On dancing shadows from behind 
 
  
 Fear of the dark fear of the dark 
 I have constant fear 
 That somethings always near 
 Fear of the dark fear of the dark 
 I have a phobia that someones always there 
 Fear of the dark fear of the dark 
 I have constant fear 
 That somethings always near 
 Fear of the dark fear of the dark 
 I have a phobia that someones always there

 I am a man who walks alone"

 From the coast of gold 
 Across the seven seas 
 Im travellin on far and wide 
 But now it seems 
 Im just a stranger to myself 
 And all the things I sometimes do 
 It isnt me but someone else 
 
  
 I close my eyes and think of home 
 Another city goes by in the night 
 Aint it funny how it is? 
 You never miss it til its gone away 
 And my heart is lying there 
 And will be til my dying day 
  
 So understand 
 Dont waste your time always searching for those wasted years 
 Face up make your stand 
 And realize youre living in the golden years 
 
  
 Too much time on my hands 
 I got you on my mind 
 Cant ease this pain so easily 
 When you cant find the words to say 
 Its hard to make it through another day 
 And it makes me wanna cry 
 And throw my hands up to the sky 
 
  
 So understand 
 Dont waste your time always searching for those wasted years 
 Face up make your stand 
 And realize youre living in the golden years 
 
  
 
  
 So understand 
 Dont waste your time always searching for those wasted years

 Kill for gain or shoot to maim 
 But we dont need a reason 
 The golden goose is on the loose 
 And never out of season 
 Blackened pride still burns inside 
 This shell of bloody treason 
 Heres my gun for a barrel of fun 
 For the love of living death 
 
  
 The killers breed or the Demons seed 
 The glamour the fortune the pain 
 Go to war again blood is freedoms stain 
 Dont you pray for my soul anymore? 
  
 2 minutes to midnight 
 The hands that threaten doom 
 2 minutes to midnight 
 To kill the unborn in the womb 
 
  
 The blind men shout ""Let the creatures out 
 Well show the unbelievers"" 
 The napalm screams of human flames 
 Of a prime time Belsen feast yeah 
 As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy 
 We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies 
 
  
 The killers breed or the Demons seed 
 The glamour the fortune the pain 
 Go to war again blood is freedoms stain 
 Dont you pray for my soul anymore? 
 
  
 2 minutes to midnight 
 The hands that threaten doom 
 2 minutes to midnight 
 To kill the unborn in the womb  
 
  
 
  
 The body bags and little rags of children torn in two 
 And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you 
 As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song 
 To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun 
 
  
 The killers breed or the Demons seed 
 The glamour the fortune the pain 
 Go to war again blood is freedoms stain 
 Dont you pray for my soul anymore? 
 
  
 2 minutes to midnight 
 The hands that threaten doom

 Woe to you oer Earth and Sea 
 For the Devil sends the beast with wrath 
 Because he knows the time is short 
 Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast 
 For it is a human number 
 Its number is six hundred and sixty-six 
 
  
 I left alone my mind was blank 
 I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind 
 What did I see? Can I believe 
 That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy? 
 Just what I saw in my old dreams 
 Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me? 
 Cos in my dreams its always there 
 The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair 
 Yeah 
  
 Night was black was no use holding back 
 Cos I just had to see was someone watching me? 
 In the mist dark figures move and twist 
 Was all this for real or just some kind of hell? 
 
  
 Six-six-six the number of the beast 
 Hell and fire was spawned to be released 
 
  
 Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased 
 As they start to cry hands held to the sky 
 In the night the fires are burning bright 
 The ritual has begun Satans work is done 
 
  
 Six-six-six the number of the beast 
 Sacrifice is going on tonight 
 
  
 
  
 This cant go on I must inform the law 
 Can this still be real or just some crazy dream? 
 But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes 
 Seem to mesmerize cant avoid the eyes  
 Six-six-six the number of the beast 
 Six-six-six the one for you and me 
 
  
 Im coming back I will return 
 And Ill possess your body and Ill make you burn 
 I have the fire I have the force 
 I have the power to make my evil take its course"

 When the priest comes to read me the last rites 
 Take a look through the bars at the last sights 
 Of a world that has gone very wrong for me 
 Can it be that theres some sort of error? 
 Hard to stop the surmounting terror 
 Is it really the end not some crazy dream? 
 
  
 Somebody please tell me that Im dreaming 
 Its not easy to stop from screaming 
 But words escape me when I try to speak 
 Tears fall but why am I crying? 
 After all Im not afraid of dying 
 Dont I believe that there never is an end? 
 
  
 
  
 As the guards march me out to the courtyard 
 Somebody cries from a cell ""God be with you"" 
 If theres a God why has He let me go? 
 As I walk my life drifts before me 
 And though the end is near Im not sorry 
 Catch my soul its willing to fly away  
 Mark my words believe my soul lives on 
 Dont worry now that I have gone 
 Ive gone beyond to seek the truth 
 When you know that your time is close at hand 
 Maybe then youll begin to understand 
 Life down here is just a strange illusion

 He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do? 
 Your tongue has frozen now youve got something to say 
 The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way 
 
  
 You watch the world exploding every single night 
 Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light 
 Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death 
 Hello to eternity and live for every breath 
  
 Your time will come 
 Your time will come 
 Your time will come 
 Your time will come

 He can push his own boat as you set off up the track 
 Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same 
 Every second is a new spark sets the universe aflame 
 
  
 You watch the world exploding every single night 
 Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light 
 Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain 
 The shadow of the wicker man is rising up again

 Across a painted desert lies a train of vagabonds 
 All thats left of what we were its what we have become 
 Once our empires glorious but now the empires gone 
 The dead gave us the time to live and now our time is done 
 
  
 Now we are victorious weve become our slaves 
 A land of hope and glory   building graveyards for the brave 
 
  
 Have you seen the writing on the wall? 
 Have you seen that writing? 
 Can you see the riders on the storm? 
 Can you see them riding? 
 Can you see them riding? 
  
 Holding onto fury is that all we ever know 
 Ignorance our judge and jury all weve got to show 
 From Hollywood to Babylon holy war to kingdom come 
 On a trail of dust and ashes when the burning sky is done 
 
  
 A tide of change is coming and that is what you fear 
 The earthquake is a-coming but you dont want to hear 
 Youre just too blind to see 
 
  
 Have you seen the writing on the wall? 
 Have you seen that writing? 
 Can you see the riders on the storm?

 Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life 
 And in the river reflections of me

 And in a movement he beckons to me 
 And in a moment the memories are all that remain 
 And all the wounds are reopen again 
  
 Were blood brothers were blood brothers 
 Were blood brothers were blood brothers 
 
  
 And as you look all around at the world in dismay 
 What do you see do you think we have learned? 
 Not if youre taking a look at the war-torn affray 
 Out in the streets where the babies are burnt 
 
  
 Were blood brothers were blood brothers 
 Were blood brothers were blood brothers 
 
  
 There are times when I feel Im afraid for the world 
 There are times Im ashamed of us all 
 When youre floating on all the emotion you feel 
 And reflecting the good and the bad 
 
  
 Will we ever know what the answer to life really is? 
 Can you really tell me what life is? 
 Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you 
 Could be swept away by fates own hand  
 Were blood brothers were blood brothers 
 Were blood brothers were blood brothers 
 
  
 
  
 When you think that weve used all our chances 
 And the chance to make everything right 
 Keep on making the same old mistakes 
 Makes untipping the balance so easy 
 When were living our lives on the edge 
 Say a prayer on the book of the dead

 Were blood brothers were blood brothers 
 Were blood brothers were blood brothers 
 Were blood brothers were blood brothers

 I wipe the sweat from my brow

 Are we partners in crime? 
 When it comes to the time 
 Well be ready to die 
 
  
 God let us go now 
 And finish whats to be done 
 Thy Kingdom come 
 Thy shall be done on Earth 
 Trying to justify to ourselves 
 The reasons to go 
 Should we live and let live? 
 Forget or forgive? 
 
  
 But how can we let them go on this way? 
 The reign of terror corruption must end 
 And we know deep down 
 Theres no other way 
 No trust no reasoning no more to say

 For I have not a mortal soul 
 That you already know 
 Look at my eyes 
 There’s no surprise 
  
 Ocean is black the devils track

 Come to claim my life again 
 Pray for me Im almost there

 To feel the same again

 Little by little eat away

 Too late to change now what I left behind 
 
  
 Hear me listen my call 
 I am ready to fall

 Let me tell you a story to chill the bones 
 About a thing that I saw 
 One night wandering in the Everglades 
 Id one drink but no more 
 I was rambling enjoying the bright moonlight 
 Gazing up at the stars 
 Not aware of a presence so near to me 
 Watching my every move 
 
  
 Feeling scared and I fell to my knees 
 As something rushed me from the trees 
 Took me to an unholy place 
 And that is where I fell from grace 
 Then they summoned me over to join in with them 
 To the dance of the dead 
 Into the circle of fire I followed them 
 Into the middle I was led 
  
 As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear 
 But still I wanted to go 
 And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me 
 As I walked onto the coals 
 And I felt I was in a trance 
 And my spirit was lifted from me 
 And if only someone had the chance 
 To witness what happened to me 
 
  
 And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them 
 All had death in their eyes 
 Lifeless figures - they were undead - all of them 
 They had ascended from hell 
 
  
 As I danced with the dead 
 My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me 
 Below my undead body 
 Just danced the circle of dead 
 Until the time came to reunite us both 
 My spirit came back down to me 
 I didnt know if I was alive or dead 
 As the others all joined in with me  
 By luck then a skirmish started 
 And took the attention away from me 
 When they took their gaze from me 
 Was the moment that I fled 
 I ran like hell faster than the wind 
 But behind I did not glance 
 One thing that I did not dare 
 Was to look just straight ahead 
 
  
 
  
 When you know that your time has come around 
 You know youll be prepared for it 
 Say your last goodbyes to everyone 
 Have a drink and say a prayer for it 
 
  
 When youre lying in your sleep when youre lying in your bed 
 And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead 
 When youre lying in your sleep when youre lying in your bed 
 And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead 
 
  
 To this day I guess Ill never know 
 Just why they let me go 
 But Ill never go dancing no more 
 Til I dance with the dead"

 The invaders repel from the north 
 Keep out nomads who come from the plains 
 Northern grasslands awash with them all 
 Blocking the tribes that invade from the south of us 
 
  
 Rallying round to the call 
 We can hear far away are the sound of distant drums 
 And they need everyone at the wall 
 So the day of our judgement has now begun to fall 
  
 Survive on ledges bitten in dust 
 Knowledge and virtue is stricken by lust 
 Really believe that theyre coming for us 
 Dancing on graves of those who bled for us 
 Driven away by our endless desire 
 Defeat by anger and our greatest fire 
 Attack again and try as they might 
 Hold them again  and see them running 
 
  
 
  
 Rallying round to the call 
 We can hear far away are the sound of distant drums 
 And they need everyone at the wall 
 So the day of our judgement has now begun to fall 
 
  
 Hear them coming 
 Ready now we wait 
 Must be steadfast 
 Must be patient 
 Must believe in 
 That we can win 
 What will save us 
 The great wall  
 Now under siege have the real strength to hold them now 
 Have to believe that we can repel them 
 Faith in the years our ancestors taught us 
 Have the belief that we can protect the wall 
 Try if they can we will overthrow them 
 Fight to the last they can never own us 
 Battle of wills well fight to the last man 
 Honour our dead so they never fought in vain 
 
  
 
  
 Hold our fortune 
 Avenge the merciful 
 Hold the great wall 
 Never fall again 
 Arrows falling 
 Dark oblivion 
 Live in spirit 
 Live to tell our sons 
 
  
 Rallying round to the call 
 We can hear far away are the sound of distant drums 
 And they need everyone at the wall 
 So the day of our judgement has now begun to fall "

 If youre feeling down depressed and lonely 
 I know a place where we can go  
 22 Acacia Avenue 
 Meet a lady that I know 
 So if youre looking for a good time 
 And youre prepared to pay the price 
 Fifteen quid is all she asks for 
 Everybodys got their vice 
 
  
 If youre waiting for a long time 
 For the rest to do their piece 
 You can tell her that you know me 
 You might even get in free 
 So any time youre down the East End 
 Dont you hesitate to go 
 You can take my honest word for it 
 Shell teach you more than you can know 
  
 Charlotte cant you get out from all this madness? 
 Cant you see it only brings you sadness? 
 When you entertain your men dont you know the risk of getting disease? 
 Some day when youve reached the age of forty 
 I bet youll regret the days when you were laying 
 Nobody then will want to know 
 You wont have any more beautiful wares to show anymore 
 
  
 22 the Avenue 
 Thats the place where we all go 
 You will find its warm inside 
 The red lights burning bright tonight 
 
  
 Charlotte isnt it time you stopped this mad life? 
 Dont you ever think about the bad times? 
 Why do you have to live this way? 
 Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay? 
 Sometimes when youre strolling down the Avenue 
 The way you walk it makes men think of having you 
 When youre walking down the street 
 Everybody stops and turns to stare at you 
 
  
 22 the Avenue 
 Thats the place where we all go 
 You will find its warm inside 
 The red lights burning bright tonight  
 Beat her mistreat her do anything that you please 
 Bite her excite her make her get down on her knees 
 Abuse her misuse her she can take all that youve got 
 Caress her molest her she always does what you want 
 
  
 
  
 Youre running away dont you know what youre doing? 
 Cant you see itll lead you to ruin? 
 Charlotte youve taken your life and youve thrown it away 
 You believe that because what youre earning 
 Your lifes good dont you know that its hurting? 
 All the people that love you dont cast them aside 
 All the men that are constantly drooling 
 Its no life for you stop all that screwing 
 Youre packing your bags youre coming with me

 That it seems that the powers getting stronger every day 
 I feel a strength an inner fire

 He could see the future penetrating right in through your mind 
 See the truth and see your lies 
 But for all his power couldnt foresee his own demise

 I couldnt hear those screams

 Suffocation waking in a sweat 
 Scared to fall asleep again 
 In case the dream begins again 
 
  
 Someone chasing I cannot move 
 Standing rigid a nightmares statue 
 What a dream when will it end and will I transcend? 
 Restless sleep the minds in turmoil 
 One nightmare ends another fertile 
 Its getting to me so scared to sleep 
 But scared to wake now in too deep 
 
  
 Even though its reached new heights 
 Id rather like the restless nights 
 It makes me wonder makes me think 
 Theres more to this Im on the brink 
 Its not the fear of whats beyond 
 Its just that I might not respond 
 I have an interest almost craving 
 But would I like to get too far in?  
 Cant be all coincidence 
 Too many things are evident 
 You tell me youre an unbeliever 
 Spiritualist? 
 Well me Im neither 
 Wouldnt you like to know the truth 
 Of whats out there to have the proof? 
 And find out just which side youre on 
 Where would you end? 
 In Heaven or in Hell? 
 
  
 Argh Oh 
 
  
 Help me 
 Help me to find my true self without seeing the future 
 Save me 
 Save me from torturing myself even within my dreams ow 
 
  
  
  
 
  
 Theres got to be just more to it than this 
 Or tell me why do we exist 
 Id like to think that when I die 
 Id get a chance another time 
 And to return and live again

 Of engines roar in the night 
 The mission is near the confident men 
 Are waiting to drop from the sky 
 
  
 The blizzard goes on but still they must fly 
 No one should go where eagles dare 
  
 Bavarian Alps that lay all around 
 They seem to stare from below 
 The enemy lines a long time passed 
 Are lying deep in the snow 
 
  
 Into the night they fall through the sky 
 No one should fly where eagles dare 
 
  
  
 
  
 Theyre closing in the fortress is near 
 Its standing high in the sky 
 The cable cars the only way in 
 Its really impossible to climb 
 
  
 They make their way but maybe too late 
 Theyve got to try to save the day 
 
  
 The panicking cries the roaring of guns 
 Are echoing all round the valley 
 The mission complete they make to escape 
 Away from the eagles nest  
 They dared to go where no one would try 
 They chose to fly where eagles dare"

 All is not it seems to be on the outside 
 Sometimes what appears to be is a show 
 What shows in the face is only a mirror 
 We all have some better places to go 
 
  
 We dont know just what we have ’til weve lost it 
 Until that time comes and know that its gone 
 So hard to say things that we should have uttered long ago 
 Tear myself away from thoughts in my head 
  
 
  
 The people worshipping the sun 
 And all the children point up to the sky 
 They see the eagle as it floats on the wind 
 And they follow with their spirits high 
 
  
 Buffalo roam on the plain 
 We walk into the flames but dance for rain 
 The hallowed dead in sacred ground the elders 
 And we wash away their sins for them 
 
  
 Feel the spirits of the old ones standing proud upon their race 
 And the testament to ancestors that are never to retrace 
 Burn the flame of innocence as they ride into the sun 
 Thinking now of our forefathers that are lying dead upon 
 Holy ground and sacred earth now 
 Revisit stolen youth 
 
  
 Lost in a lost world 
 Buried on sacred ground 
 Lost in a lost world 
 Lying on sacred ground  
 
  
 
  
 Lost in a lost world 
 Buried on sacred ground 
 Lost in a lost world 
 Lying on sacred ground 
 
  
 Lost in a lost world 
 Standing on sacred ground 
 Lost in a lost world 
 Lying on sacred ground 
 
  
 Will we ever heal our old wounds 
 Like forever darkness worn 
 Fighting for their lives again 
 So come on now don’t be afraid 
 This is where destiny lies 
 Just to let us breathe again 
 Put upon this earth to wander 
 And to walk forever lost With the ashes of our enemies 
 To live among our ghosts 
 Of our past fear nothing 
 Life is but a better path to joy 
 Nowhere to go nowhere to run 
 Our whole nation overrun 
 Itself existence under threat 
 And soon will be none of us left 
 
 Remember names of all our dead now 
 And enemies that fled 
 Reaching for our sky forever free 
 A sadness that is proud 
 As the clouds all drift away now 
 Until we meet again"

 My spirit wanders endlessly 
 Until the day will dawn and friends 
 From home discover why 
 Hear me calling rescue me 
 Set me free set me free

 To find the answer to the mystery 
 They found his body lying 
 Where it fell on that day 
 Preserved in time for all to see

 Here they stand brothers them all 
 All the sons divided theyd fall 
 Here await the birth of the son 
 The seventh the heavenly the chosen one 
 Oh

 Born the healer the seventh his time 
 Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds 
 Slowly unveiling the power he holds 
 Oh

 The Good and the Evil which path will he take? 
 Both of them trying to manipulate 
 The use of his powers before its too late

 Hear the rime of the ancient Mariner 
 See his eye as he stops one of three 
 Mesmerises one of the wedding guests 
 Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea 
 
 And the music plays on as the bride passes by 
 Caught by a spell and the Mariner tells his tale 
 
  
 Driven south to the land of the snow and ice 
 To a place where nobodys been 
 Through the snow fog flies on the Albatross 
 Hailed in Gods name hoping good luck it brings 
 And the ship sails on back to the north 
 Through the fog and ice and the Albatross follows on 
 
  
 The Mariner kills the bird of good omen 
 His shipmates cry against what hes done 
 But when the fog clears they justify him 
 And make themselves a part of the crime 
 
  
 Sailing on and on and north across the sea 
 Sailing on and on and north til all is calm 
 
  
 The Albatross begins with its vengeance 
 A terrible curse  a thirst has begun 
 His shipmates blame bad luck on the Mariner 
 About his neck the dead bird is hung 
 
  
 And the curse goes on and on and on at sea 
 And the thirst goes on and on for them and me 
 
  
 ""Day after day day after day 
 We stuck nor breath nor motion 
 As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean 
 Water water everywhere and all the boards did shrink 
 Water water everywhere nor any drop to drink""  
 
  
 ""There"" calls the Mariner ""There comes a ship o’er the line 
 But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?"" 
 See onward she comes 
 Onward she nears out of the sun 
 See she has no crew 
 She has no life wait but theres two 
 
  
 Death and she Life-in-Death 
 They throw their dice for the crew 
 She wins the Mariner and he belongs to her now 
 Then crew one by one 
 They drop down dead two hundred men 
 She she Life-in-Death 
 She lets him live her chosen one 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 ""One after one by the star-dogged Moon 
 Too quick for groan or sigh 
 Each turned his face with a ghastly pang 
 And cursed me with his eye 
 Four times fifty living men 
 And I heard nor sigh nor groan 
 With heavy thump a lifeless lump 
 They dropped down one by one.""  
 
  
 The curse it lives on in their eyes 
 The Mariner he wished hed die 
 Along with the sea creatures 
 But they lived on so did he 
 
  
 And by the light of the Moon 
 He prays for their beauty not doom 
 With heart he blesses them 
 Gods creatures all of them too 
 
  
 Then the spell starts to break 
 The Albatross falls from his neck 
 Sinks down like lead into the sea 
 Then down in falls comes the rain Hahahaha 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 Hear the groans of the long-dead seamen 
 See them stir and they start to rise 
 Bodies lifted by good spirits 
 None of them speak and theyre lifeless in their eyes 
 
 And revenge still is sought penance starts again 
 Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on 
 
  
 Now the curse is finally lifted 
 And the Mariner sights his home 
 Spirits go from the long-dead bodies 
 Form their own light and the Mariners left alone 
 
  
 And then a boat came sailing towards him 
 It was a joy he could not believe 
 The Pilots boat his son and the Hermit 
 Penance of life will fall onto him 
 
  
 And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea 
 And the Hermit shrieves the Mariner of his sins 
 
  
 The Mariners bound to tell of his story 
 To tell this tale wherever he goes 
 To teach Gods word by his own example 
 That we must love all things that God made 
 
  
 And the Wedding guests a sad and wiser man 
 And the tale goes on and on and on and on"

 I have sailed to many lands 
 Now I make my final journey 
 On the bow I stand 
 West is where I go 
 Through the night I plough 
 Still my heart calculate and pray 
 As the compass swings my will is strong 
 I will not be led astray 
 
  
 Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun 
 But I know but I know but I know 
  
 I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost 
 As they sail into the sunset theyll count the cost 
 As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea 
 The sirens of the rocks they beckon me 
 
  
 Take my heart and set it free 
 Carried forward by the waves 
 Nowhere left to run navigators son 
 Chasing rainbows all my days 
 
 Where I go I do not know 
 I only know the place Ive been 
 Dreams they come and go ever shall be so 
 Nothings real until you feel 
 
  
 I steer between the crashing rocks 
 The sirens call my name 
 Lash my hands onto the helm 
 Blood surging with the strain 
 I will not fail now 
 As sunrise comes the darkness left behind 
 For eternity I follow on there is no other way  
 Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun 
 But I know but I know but I know 
 
  
 I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost 
 As they sail into the sunset theyll count the cost 
 As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea 
 The sirens of the rocks they beckon me

 Carried forward by the waves 
 Nowhere left to run navigators son 
 Chasing rainbows all my days

 With your wooden sword so mighty 
 Youre St. George or youre David and you always killed the beast

 A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet 
 
  
 You die as you lived in a flash of the blade 
 In a corner forgotten by no one 
 You lived for the touch for the feel of the steel 
 One man and his honour 
  
 The smell of resined leather the steely iron mask 
 As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing masters call 
 He taught you all he ever knew to fear no mortal man 
 And now youll wreak your vengeance in the screams of evil men 
 
  
 You die as you lived in a flash of the blade 
 In a corner forgotten by no one 
 You lived for the touch for the feel of the steel 
 One man and his honour

 But somehow back there time again 
 Im on the edge that you cant see 
 I’m not particular at night 
 A single particle of me 
 You won’t be tracking me by sight 
 
  
 Shadows in the stars 
 We will not return 
 Humanity wont save us 
 At the speed of light 
 Shadows in the stars 
 We will not return 
 Humanity wont save us 
 We slip into the night Shadows in the stars 
 We will not return 
 Humanity wont save us 
 At the speed of light 
 Shadows in the stars 
 We will not return 
 Humanity wont save us 
 We slip into the night 
 
 Shadows in the stars 
 We will not return 
 Humanity wont save us 
 At the speed of light 
 Shadows in the stars 
 We will not return 
 Humanity wont save us 
 We slip into the night 
 
 Shadows in the stars 
 We will not return 
 Humanity wont save us 
 At the speed of light 
 Shadows in the stars 
 We will not return 
 Humanity wont save us 
 We slip into the night"
